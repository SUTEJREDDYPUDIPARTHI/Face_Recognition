Face_Recognition🔍👤

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of face recognition using Python, OpenCV, and the `face_recognition` library.

Features 🚀

- Detects faces in real-time using OpenCV.
- Load and encode faces from known images.
- Compares faces with stored images for recognition.
- Display result: whether faces match or not.
- Supports adding new faces to the dataset.

Requirements 📦

Python 3.7 – 3.11

OpenCV (`opencv-python`)

Face_Recognition (which depends on `dlib`)

Numpy

Setup & Installation 📥

1️⃣ Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/SUTEJREDDYPUDIPARTHI/Face_Recognition

2️⃣ Install dependencies:
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
pip install face_recognition

Usage 🎯

Run the script to start face detection and recognition.

Add new faces by saving images in the images folder.
